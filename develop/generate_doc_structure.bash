## This script was used to create the initial structure of the sphinx documentation.
## There should be no need to run this script if the directory doc/ already exists in the repo. Just edit the files in there and re-run `make` in the doc/ directory.
##
## This script requires sphinx-apidoc, which is provided by sphinx: `pip install sphinx` or see http://www.sphinx-doc.org
