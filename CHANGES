Brainload Changes
=================


Version 0.3.1
--------------
- Added support for loading FreeSurfer annotation files. This allows one to load cortical parcellation information from an Atlas, e.g., from the Desikan atlas from the '?h.aparc.annot' files.
- Added support for loading FreeSurfer label files. This allows one to sets of vertices assigned to a group, e.g., the list of all vertices which belong to the cortex from the files '?h.cortex.label'.
- Add support for masking data using an arbitrary mask, i.e., set the data values to NaN at a list of indices. Typically this is used to mask out the medial wall in brain morphometry data. You can use any data, e.g., a loaded label, to build the mask.

Version 0.3.0
--------------
- Added support for Python 3. We now test for Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6 on Travis CI.
- Renamed all occurrences of the word morphology to morphometry, including in meta data entries and function names. This breaks compatibility with v0.2.0.
- Extend documentation: add workflow examples. The documentation is no longer only API documentation.
- Add recipe for anaconda build.


Version 0.2.0
--------------
- First official version.
- Added API methods for loading group data.
- Renamed spatial_transform module to spatial. This breaks compatibility with previous versions.
- Added methods for checking for files in subject directories in nitools module.
